LAUGH OR DARE

--Project Description--

This project explores the genre of live video-based games, hoping to lessen the separation that social distancing creates. This specific app will use a ReactNative/NodeJS framework, along with the Zoom API and a few simple AI libraries. Users will be able to join with their friends over zoom and compete either to remain straight-faced or else get the other person to laugh. Causing a laugh grants one point, while laughing removes one. The first person to reach 5 points "wins" the game is granted the prestigious title of "Mr. Earl Grey" for the next round.
