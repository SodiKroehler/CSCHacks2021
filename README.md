# Mr. Earl Grey

## Project Description
This project explores the genre of live video-based games, hoping to lessen the separation that social distancing creates. This specific app will use a ReactNative/NodeJS framework, along with the Zoom API and a few simple AI libraries. Collectively, we have very limited experience with face recognition libraries, so doing this project will require extensive understanding of them to be gained. Users will be able to join with their friends over zoom and compete either to remain straight-faced or else get the other person to laugh, which will be detected by the AI algorithim.  Causing a laugh grants one point, while laughing removes one. The first person to reach 5 points "wins" the game is granted the prestigious title of "Mr. Earl Grey" for the next round. The biggest challenger here is definitley going to be understanding and correctly implementing the software.
